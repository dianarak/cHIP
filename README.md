# Combining Rule-Enhanced Hammett-Inspired Product Model

This repository contains the script for the combining rule-enhanced (c) Hammett-Inspired Product model by V. Diana Rakotonirina, Marco Bragato, Stefan Heinen, and O. Anatole von Lilienfeld, described in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.07747).

## Folders

### `libnew`

This folder builds upon the work of Bragato et al. ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1039/D0SC04235H)), with the addition of the cHIP script at the end of the `core.py` file. 

*Note: Both the HIP and cHIP models are thoroughly described in our preprint.*

### `example`

This folder contains a script that demonstrates how to use the cHIP model.

*Note: A tutorial for the HIP library is available [here](https://doi.org/10.1039/D0SC04235H).*
